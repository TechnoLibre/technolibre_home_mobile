# TechnoLibre Home Capacitor

This repository contains an Odoo Owl/Capacitor project.

The following sections outline instructions on the proper use of the provided scripts, as well as the errors you may encounter when setting up a new project and how to deal with them.

## Installation

To install the npm dependencies required for the development of the web app, run:

```
npm install
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This command must be executed from the `technolibre_home` folder to install the correct packages.

## Running the app

These commands run the application on android, but it can also be done with ios if the platform is installed properly.

```bash
# Builds and syncs the application
npm run build && npx cap sync

# Runs the app (android)
npx cap run android

# Runs the app (iOS)
npx cap run ios
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> These commands must be executed from the `technolibre_home` folder.

For a more convenient way of building, syncing and running the application, check out the [BSR Script](#bsr-script) section.

## Deleting node_modules

Sometimes, you might want to remove the node_modules folder and reinstall the npm packages to solve issues.

> [!CAUTION]  
> When deleting `node_modules`, you are preventing the npm packages, such as `@odoo/owl` or `@capacitor/app` from working until they are reinstalled.

```bash
# Delete node_modules
rm -rf node_modules

# Reinstall packages
npm install
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> These commands must be executed from the `technolibre_home` folder.

## Pruning

To only uninstall packages that aren't actual depencencies from node_modules, you can run the prune command.

```
npm prune
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> These commands must be executed from the `technolibre_home` folder.

## BSR Script

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The BSR script must be executed from the `technolibre_home` folder.

This section provides details about the BSR scripts that can be executed from the root of the `technolibre_home` folder.

BSR means _Build_, _Sync_ and _Run_, common actions during development. Since you'll often need to build the application and launch it on specific devices, this script was built to make this workflow faster.

Here are the commands

`npm run bsr`: Builds the app and starts it on localhost (web)

`npm run bsr web`: Same as `npm run bsr`

`npm run bsr ios`: Builds and syncs the app, then runs it on an iOS device.

`npm run bsr android`: Builds and syncs the app, then runs it on an android device.

## GenComp Script

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The GenComp script must be executed from the `technolibre_home` folder.

This section provices details on the GenComp script.

GenComp means _Generate Component_. The Script allows you to generate a boilerplate Owl component so you can start programming component features faster.

### Commands

`npm run gencomp <name>`: Generates the component in the `components` folder  
`npm run gencomp <name> <path>`: Generates the component in the provided folder  
`npm run gencomp <name> <path> <add-css>`: Generates the component in the provided folder, and omits the CSS file if add-css is set to `false`.

### Parameters

#### Name

Name of the component, will have "Component" appended to it automatically.

#### Path

Path of the component relative to the `components` folder.

A path of `notes/item` will create the component in `src/components/notes/item`.

Optional parameter.

#### AddCSS

If set to `false`, the CSS file will not be created and it will not be added to the imports in `src/css/components.scss`.

Optional parameter.

### Example

`npm run gencomp noteItem notes/item false` will create the component `NoteItem` in `src/components/notes/item` without the CSS file.
